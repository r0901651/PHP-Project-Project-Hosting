# Project PHP | 2 ITF APP-AI-ACS | 2022-2023

## Team: DDP-A
## Client: Dirk De Peuter
## Subject: Job Application Training
### Background information
The IT factory at Thomas More university of Applied Sciences organises Job application training for its more than 160 third-year graduating students by giving them the opportunity to participate in up to three mock job interviews with a designated recruit from participating IT companies (about 20 each year).  The main goal is to help students increase their job prospects by providing them with the skills and knowledge they need to effectively market themselves to potential employers.

In the current system, two teachers from the IT factory (ITF) coordinate and manage this annual program using various software programs such as Word and Excel documents, google forms and the like and various platforms such as email, canvas and the like.  Information about the companies should be available to the students so that they can select 3 companies to attend their training. The coordinator registers potential students to participate in the given training.

Before uploading the companies' information, the coordinator should update the list of participating companies. The companies' information consists of details about the organisation and the contact person. First, they need to register the companies in case a new company wants to participate. On the other hand, they only need to update the list of previous participants depending on their willingness to participate in the training again. If the contact person is changed, a coordinator must update the contact person's information.

To make company information available to students, coordinators must upload each company's information on Canvas. If there are new participating companies, they must be created. If the company changes its information, then it must be updated. After this, the coordinators structure the possible time slots and then the students can book 3 of them. At the end of the process, students have to fill in the feedback form about the training. With such an approach, it is difficult to keep track of all documents, it is labour intensive because the information is on different platforms, parties other than the coordinators cannot enter information, it is difficult for the coordinator to get information about activities, and the coordinator has to manually enter and update information.

### Objectives and target groups 
The main purpose of the requested web application is to simplify the administration process and enable the coordinator to easily manage booking and appointment information on the parties involved. This will make the coordinator's task easier and clearer. 

More specifically, the target groups involved, namely coordinators, companies and students, will experience the following benefits: coordinators will spend much less time managing student accounts, communicating with students and companies, and performing labour-intensive tasks such as booking interviews, managing appointments and providing feedback that will be easily managed. Companies, on the other hand, will be able to easily share and update information about their companies and students will be able to easily view participating companies, choose appropriate interviews and book more efficiently. Information about scheduled interviews will be more clearly available to them, reducing the risk of forgetting and overlapping interviews. Moreover, they will have the freedom to cancel or reschedule an interview even before a deadline.
